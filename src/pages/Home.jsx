        <h1>Hi, I’m Nishanth Kunchala!</h1>
        <p>
        I’m a rising senior pursuing a Bachelor’s degree of science in Aerospace Engineering at The Ohio State University. 
        Passionate about space systems and embedded software, I have hands-on experience in avionics design, AI-driven vision systems, and robotics integration. 
        My technical journey includes projects ranging from machine learning model development to flight hardware prototyping, with a focus on real-world aerospace applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        Beyond engineering, I’m an Eagle Scout with a strong foundation in leadership, discipline, and teamwork, which I bring to every project and collaboration. 
        I thrive in challenging environments where I can merge my software skills and aerospace knowledge to innovate solutions for next-generation space missions.
        </p>
        <p>
        I’m excited to connect with professionals and contribute to cutting-edge aerospace and robotics projects.
